## Git Flow
    When we are using git flow, we create a repository firstly, add collaborators and start the project. Basically, we have a remote repository and several local repositories which are cloned from the remote repository or another remote repository which is forked from the original one. We use git add and git commit commands to submit the change on the codes and documents. 
    
    Here is a typical example: we create and checkout a new branch from the master branch. Then we add and commit the changes to the local git. After that, we can push them to the remote repository. We can also push them to the forked repository, and then raise a pull request to the original repository. If the repository has been updated by others, we could also pull the changes to the local repository easily.
    
    We can check the status of the git by using git status, which shows us the workspace of the git. We can also use git rm to  remove files from the remote repository and remove command to remove branches. We can get information of the commits by using git show.
